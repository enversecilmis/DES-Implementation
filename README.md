<h1>Data Encryption Standart (DES) implementation.</h1>
<br/>
DES is a symmetric encryption algorithm, meaning that you use the same key to encrypt and decrypt the data.
</br>
<br/>
<h2>Usage</h2>

```javascript encryption
encryptDES("8charkey", "text to be encrypted");
```
```javascript decryption
decryptDES("8charkey", "t3xt 2 be d3crypt3d");
```
