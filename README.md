<h1>Data Encryption Standart (DES) implementation.</h1>
<br/>
DES is a symmetric encryption algorithm,
</br>
meaning that you use the same key to encrypt and decrypt.
</br>
<br/>
<p>Usage:</p>
```javascript encryption
encryptDES("8charkey", "text to be encrypted")
```
```javascript decryption
decryptDES("8charkey", "t3xt 2 be d3crypt3d")
```


This project made for a school assignment.
<br/>
DES algorithm is deprecated and replaced by Advanced Encryption Standart (AES).
