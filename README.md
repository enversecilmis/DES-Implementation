<h1>Data Encryption Standart (DES) algorithm implementation.</h1>
<br/>
DES algorithm is deprecated and replaced by Advanced Encryption Standart (AES).
<br/>
This project made for a school assignment.
<br/>
<br/>
The way it works is it takes an 8-character key and data as string.
<br/>
Then returns ciphered string.
